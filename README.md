 Go Encryption and Decryption Project 🛡️
 Introduction
 This project is an implementation of a simple encryption and decryption algorithm in Go. It showcases the basic principles of data encryption and decryption, which are fundamental in ensuring data security and privacy. The program takes plain text input, applies an encryption algorithm to produce ciphered text, and then can reverse the process, converting the encrypted text back into its original form. 🔐

 Features
 🌟 Simple Caesar Cipher: Implements a basic shift cipher where the letters of the alphabet are shifted by a fixed number of positions.
 🔒 Encryption & Decryption: Offers both encryption and decryption functionalities.
 🔑 Customizable Shift Key: Allows users to specify the shift key for the cipher.
 📝 Handling of Non-Alphabetic Characters: Preserves spaces, numbers, and punctuation in the text.

 Getting Started
 These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

 Prerequisites
 What things you need to install the software and how to install them:
 - Go (Golang) - Download and Install Go

 Installing
 A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

 Clone the Repository:
 git clone https://github.com/Shawn1042/go-encryption.git

 Navigate to the Directory:
 cd go-encryption

 Run the Program:
 go run main.go

 Usage
 To use this program, follow these steps:

// Run the program - Execute the script using the Go command:
// go run main.go
// Enter Plain Text - Provide the text that you want to encrypt.
// Specify the Key - Set the shift key for the Caesar cipher.
// View Output - The program will display the encrypted text and the decrypted text (which should match the original plain text).
